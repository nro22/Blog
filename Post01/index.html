        <h1>Post #01</h1>
        <h2>A video and commentary of Cameron Hane’s Keep Hammering Podcast Episode 003 (Chris Williamson)</h2>
        <h3>Topic: Men’s struggles in a postmodern feminist age</h3>
            <div class="summary">
                <p>Consider this specific case of mentally-ill men during the Blitz of World War II who had for years been hospitalized, rehabilitated but ultimately stymied by their illnesses. When confronted with an extreme emergency, these men miraculously overcame their disabilities and accomplished a heroic feat collectively. This example demonstrates how in the face of duty, limitations can be overcome. It goes to show that individuals struggling today, and not just men, can regain their livelihoods by ironically, struggling towards a fulfilling sense of purpose. And that’s the essence of what Cam and Chris are discussing in this video, the lack of purpose that many men experience, the resulting feeling of emasculation and how these individuals and society can move forward.
                </p>
                <p>An issue discussed in the video is the concept of men being subdued into domesticated, docile beings and stripped of respect in society. It’s a bit of an extreme narrative for any rational mind and I may have intentionally exaggerated their rhetoric. However, a rational being could understand and admit this narrative exists in some corners of modern media and ideologies. A rational mind certainly couldn’t squash and invalidate the fact many men believe and feel as if parts of society are indeed attempting to subdue them into domesticated, docile beings stripped of respect. This dangerous socio-political rhetoric and resulting feelings may be a contributing factor to the struggle and suicide rates that men and particularly “unaccomplished” men are exhibiting.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, opportunities of indulgence such as video-games, drugs and pornography create a faux sense of purpose. As individuals withdraw further and further from a meaningful existence, these alternatives become increasingly appetizing and exacerbate the issue. In the video, Chris describes the slippery slope of a future we’re headed towards.

                <p>My personal advice, inspired from accomplished scientists, authors, podcasters, etc. is for men and society to take responsibility. As Jocko Willink themes: Extreme Ownership. Doing so puts our culture in a position to understand the nuances of struggles that both men and women experience. Importantly, men and especially young-men should attempt to understand the importance of taking responsibility for their situations and lives. This is a path towards awareness of the situation without a victim-mindset or a need to blame externalities. The result is discovery, enlightenment, astonishment, purpose and ultimately, fulfillment.
                </p>
                <p>What I think this looks like in practice for men and young-men: Do your best to achieve your full potential. Think of life as a marathon, and do your best to set and achieve fulfilling goals while maintaining a sense of presence each day. Compartmentalize your life and develop each area while recognizing their interconnectedness. For example, physical health is going to contribute towards confidence, romantic experiences, and longevity. Another example being sleep, which impacts mental acuity and physical performance. Just these two facets alone exhibit overlap.
                </p>
                <p>Simply creating healthy habits and making first-class decisions will create general opportunities and satisfaction. Finally, having the desire and discipline to take control of your life and squeeze everything out of your one chance in life will create the realization for the importance of pace, presence and balance to provide fulfillment when it comes to family, career, spirit, recreation, health and relationships.
                </p>
                <p>As Maslow suggests, start with food, sleep, clothing, and shelter. When you start feeling comfortable and notice yourself drifting into a cog rotating between endless social media scrolling, mindless reality-tv, video games, alcohol, drugs, and pornography - truly ask yourself: what are the next steps toward self actualization and how to participate in these adventures.
