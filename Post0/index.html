        <h2>Clips and commentary of Dr. Andrew Huberman’s podcast, The Huberman Lab Podcast</h2>
        <h3>The podcast episode in discussion: "Dr. Gabrielle Lyon: How to Exercise & Eat for Optimal Health & Longevity"</h3>
        <p class="section">In the clip they’re discussing a study of two different groups, both at a caloric deficit but varying in diet. One group eating the standard American diet and the other group, “the high protein group”, eating a serving of 25-30+ grams of high-quality protein in their first meal. Exercise was not included as part of the study. So two groups: The standard american diet group and "high protein" group; both in caloric deficit, but neither exercising.</p>
        <p class="section">There’s a lot of context missing from this clip but I really wanted to share these two key takeaways: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The high protein group lost 8% less lean body mass (human body weight excluding fat and bone; more lean body mass is better) than the group eating the standard american diet. (An amazing benefit)
            </li>
            <li>
                The high protein group lost more body fat relative to the group eating a standard american diet.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <label>Here’s the brief clip of reference which is much more concise:</label>

        <p class="section">One of my interpretations from the podcast and this specific clip: Any adult looking to improve their body composition, prevent chronic diseases like cancer, or lose stubborn body fat should be eating a serving of at least 25 grams of animal-based protein in their first meal. Unfortunately, this number is even higher for older individuals.</p>
        <p class="section aside">Also mentioned by Dr. Gabrielle Lyon, but not in this clip, is that the FDA recommended values are the bare minimums to prevent deficiencies. Therefore to maintain, build or simply sustain an optimal physiology, the FDA values are not sufficient. I think this is really profound and puts into perspective why 50 grams of daily protein (About 2 eggs in the morning and 2 hamburgers throughout the day, a common example of a daily diet) is not the path towards long term health.</p>
        <p class="section clip--two">In this second clip, it’s essentially the same controls except each group is further split into exercise and non-exercise subgroups. The result: the high-protein group with exercise experienced compounded benefits due to the anabolic and protein synthesizing effects of exercise. Here's the clip:</p>

        </iframe>
        <p class="section anecdote"><b>The bare minimum you need to be doing:</b> Eat 25+ grams of protein in the morning, walk 30 minutes a day x 5 days per week, and perform light training such as yoga or calisthenics twice a week.</p>

            <p>Flexbox was used for the layout of this post. It's certainly not my best exhibition of writing.</p>
