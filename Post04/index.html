            <h2>Notes from an episode of Dr. Andrew Huberman's podcast</h2>
            <h3>Episode in focus: "Dr. Cal Newport: How To Enhance Focus and Improve Productivity"</h3>
            <p>Dr. Andrew Huberman is a renowned neuroscientist and professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, where he specializes in neurobiology. He hosts the popular "Huberman Lab Podcast," where he explores various aspects of neuroscience, health, and human performance, often featuring expert guests and practical insights. </p>
            <p>The guest from the episode, Dr. Cal Newport is an accomplished author, professor of computer science, and expert on the intersection of technology, work, and personal productivity.</p>
            <p>In the episode, they discuss protocols for enhancing focus and productivity, time management, task prioritization, and improving work-life balance.</p>
            <p class="commentary">Dr. Cal Newport primarily writes on how we can become productive and focused when it comes to cognitively demanding work. A concept he focuses on is context switching. The idea is simple: constantly switching tasks, physically hinders our ability to complete cognitively complex and demanding work. This is especially critical to individuals whose primary roles are thinking critically and creatively to produce.</p>
            <p class="commentary">The primary culprits are social media and digital communication. Not only do these activities halt the process of conscious and unconscious problem solving but we cannot immediately resume our pace of thought after these activities. Everyone has probably experienced a moment during work, and a few minutes after receiving a text - they notice looking at their phone for no reason. Even if the initial notification is not viewed or responded to, it’s created a subconscious trigger that will be distracting for some time after. Anytime we engage in one of these activities we become disabled and distracted from deep thinking for some time after.</p>
            <p class="commentary">The #1 technique for improving focus and productivity is simply the removal of social media. This can be the removal of apps from accessible devices, the deletion of social media accounts altogether, or the shutting down of devices and/or removal from proximity during periods of focused work. He explains that these apps are designed to create cravings for looking, opening and scrolling. To demonstrate the point, Dr. Newport suggests that smartphones aren’t even interesting without social media; I think that’s a pretty valid point.</p>
            <p class="commentary">Furthermore, he suggests setting the expectation that we are not available for contact during the day or at least not during certain hours. He explains that the importance of always being available via phone or email is overrated. Influx of emails, texts and calls throughout the day are all moments of context-switching that limit the productiveness of Deep-Work. Dr. Newport is an advocate for society and workplaces to come to this realization and create systems for better communication.</p>
            <p class="commentary">Quite simply, every single notification or glance at our smartphone is a context switch to our brains. Whether we agree or consciously think about the occurrence, to some degree it has the same effect.</p>
