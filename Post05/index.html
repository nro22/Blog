            <h2>Men's Mental Health Awareness Month and Healthy Masculinity</h2>
            <h3>A call to action</h3>
            <p>Here are a couple of brilliant youtube videos that I found to be helpful in explaining the issues men face. Sorry for the additional links, there are embedding restrictions on these videos specifically. The first video is extremely concise and considerate of all the nuances involved in a topic like this:</p>

            <p>Anyone close to me knows how much I absolutely love podcasts. In recent years, they’ve become one of my main ways to learn, reflect, and pass the time. More than that, they’ve had an enormous and unquantifiably positive impact on my life.</p>

            <p>Lately, I’ve noticed a mature and thoughtful movement in the podcast space to acknowledge and address men’s issues—especially the struggles young men and boys are facing. These conversations are often sparked or grounded in statistics like the ones shared, as well as countless stories, comments, and anecdotal experiences. Among the many groups that deserve support, males need to be part of the conversation too. These issues are why our boys become the men in these statistics.</p>
            
            <p>Inspired by a friend’s recent post, I want to contribute to that movement—and I hope, in some way, this reaches someone who needs it.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Those who know me well understand I’m not politically charged, so bear with me on this next part, I promise there’s no political motive, but consider this:</p>
            <p>Young men, Latino men, and mothers may have been the deciding demographics in the last presidential election. There’s compelling data to support these claims, and unless there’s a major shift in other voting blocs, issues affecting men are likely to remain pivotal in future elections.</p>
            
            <p>If that doesn’t sound accurate, consider this: the current awareness of men’s issues is partially evident in Tim Walz being chosen as Kamala Harris’ running mate. Conversely—and this may be controversial to some—do you recall Kamala Harris ever speaking positively about men, boys, or the unique struggles they face? If not, that absence is telling. Either these concerns weren’t fully understood, or the campaign didn’t prioritize them. If that’s the case, I think it’s fair to say that males are still lacking the full support and representation they need. This isn’t about politics, and it wasn’t meant to be—this is about the fact that there is a lack of understanding and consideration for the male experience, even by men.</p>
            
            <p>Based on the data, it’s clear: men and boys need to be embraced by society. If none of that resonates, then ask yourself—why does talking about men’s struggles, the male experience, and male livelihood still feel uncomfortable or invalid? And is your reasoning sound? I’d be genuinely interested in that take; I’m almost always open to learning.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Loving one child doesn’t mean you love your other child less. In the same way, supporting males—and especially our boys—doesn’t subtract from our ability to care for other groups. If we choose the converse, we’re only setting ourselves up for more division. Personally, I’d prefer a less divided, less polarized society.</p>
            
            <p>History proves that failing to consider an entire group causes harm to society as a whole—whether immediately or down the road. So in a logically fallacious, but facetiously fallacious way, leaving men and boys behind results in a net harm to society. Returning to a no-longer facetiously fallacious manner: that harm already exists—and will only escalate if left unaddressed. So how will we engage with males and their concerns moving forward? And how might society benefit if men’s issues were given the weight they deserve?</p>
            
            <p>To go even deeper, I’d ask: when exactly did males begin to fall behind? Why do boys and young men increasingly struggle to adapt in today’s world? In both a polarizing way to some and a common-sense way to others, I’d argue that the male experience is more important than ever if we want to create a healthier society—and prevent our boys from being disconnected and becoming even more disconnected as men. Without healthy masculinity, where do our boys go?</p>
            <hr>
            <p>If any of this resonates, check in on a male (man, boy, or somewhere in between). Find out how he’s really doing—beyond the usual “I’m good.”</p>
            
            <p>If you’re a woman, consider how much you truly understand about the male experience—and even the experience of a young boy. What’s your level of understanding and relatability when it comes to the impact of healthy masculinity and male relationships on the developing male and the male experience?</p>
            
            <p><strong>And if you’re a man:</strong></p>
            <p>I challenge you to be a leader to the men and women in your life. Continually check in on the men you’re close with—emotionally and mentally—and I mean how they’re really doing. If you don’t already, start talking openly with the women in your life. Be emotionally available to them and try to connect daily with as many people as possible in your life. I don’t think men are truly understood, and I’m challenging you to be that voice.</p>
            
            <p>Even more importantly, check in on how the boys in your life are developing—emotionally, mentally, and physically. In addition, be a healthy role model in all of those aspects. It only takes a few good men within close proximity to fill the gaps in healthy masculinity.</p>
            
            <p>And if you’re the one struggling—please talk to someone. Me, a friend, a mentor, even a stranger. Just talk.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Lastly, I encourage everyone to find a moment and genuinely thank someone who has made a difference in your life. If that’s easy, try doing it for everyone who’s had an impact on you. If you’re reading this—you’ve been one of those people in my life. So thank you.</p>
            
            <p>Want to go a step further? Bring some of this into your next political conversation. These issues shouldn’t be a quiet side note anymore.</p>
            
            <p>If you made it this far, thanks for coming to my TED Talk.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>There’s definitely a lot of missing context that should've been added to this post, so I apologize about that. I didn't plan for this to be as nearly as long as it was.</p>
            <p>If you’re interested in finding out more about men’s issues, Scott Galloway is a prominent figure in the space and advocate for other social issues. Additionally, he’s a moving and entertaining speaker, a best-selling author, professor, serial entrepreneur, husband, father and hosts two podcasts. Chris Williamson’s podcast, Modern Wisdom, is arguably the most brilliant podcast I’ve listened to. He’s incredible as a host and covers a wide variety of topics often with highly credible guests. Steven Bartlett’s Diary of a CEO is a podcast similar to Modern Wisdom. Steven's podcast is larger and more professional and he's had some quality episodes on the topic as well.</p>
